title: How I got my first Google Cloud Certificate ‚òÅÔ∏è

When I started my Master's Degree one of the things I wanted to do was learn AWS and get certified, so that I could land a good internship.
I created a AWS account and started learning but the material I was using was dry and boring, so I dropped the idea and decided to focus on other things.
During my summer internship I was using GCP for a lot of things, so I started learning GCP naturally through documentation and QwikLabs, after 3 months I had a basic understanding of how GCP and its services work, this is when I started to get interested in learning more.

After reading some reviews on medium and reddit, I felt confident and registered myself for the exam on a day 1 month away.
I found some free material on Youtube by Antonio Tzavelas - [GCP ACE Pass the Exam!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpno8FSqpc8&t=35227s) I spent over 2 weeks to skim through the content, making notes.
Later I attempted some questions that were available online including the chapter wise questions from Dan Sullivan's Book and GCP's official review questions. Then I did a 2nd pass through the video emphasizing on the topics that I was not doing well with. I repeated this cycle one more time. All this took me about 4 weeks and I reached the test day.

The test was remote and proctored so I cleared up my room and had my passport for ID verification. Most of the questions were straightforward but some of them felt very tricky so I marked them for later. The majority of what I answered were what I studied from the video content and mock questions. I did guess work on the rest of the tougher ones. After 2 hours I was relived to see the 'PASS' status on my test. But I saved my celebration until I got the official email from Google üëá

The new knowledge of various services did not go in vain as I was able to put a lot of it to work in my Fall internship !
