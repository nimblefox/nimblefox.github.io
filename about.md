My name is Farooq, a Problem Solver 👨‍🔧 I love to solve problems that help others, or create a positive impact. \
If I dont have a problem to solve, I find one 😄 \
I studied Mechanical Engineering 🛠 where I built my strong mathematics, and logical reasoning foundation. Later I worked for Accenture where I found my new interest in Data Science and Analytics 📊
